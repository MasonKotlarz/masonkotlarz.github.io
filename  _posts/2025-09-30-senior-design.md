Problem Statement: Security testing can be a lengthy and difficult process. Many problems can exist within a software system, and it takes extensive time and effort for testers to identify them. To assist with this process, many engineers use automated fuzzers.

Modern fuzzers are highly effective, but they are slow and limited in scope. Due to the nondeterministic nature of fuzzing, our team believes this issue is a fantastic application for Artificial Intelligence (AI).
