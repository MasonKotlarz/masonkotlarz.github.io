### About

 I worked as an Information Security Intern and then Specialist as I transitioned to go part time at Mary Greeley Medical Center, where I played a key role in enhancing the organization's security posture. I was responsible for implementing endpoint protection policies, which increased our security score by 10%. I also had the opportunity to lead and assist the security team investigations and coordinate incident responses. We used tools like Microsoft Defender and LogRhythm to follow the SANS PICERL response cycle. I also did work as a desktop engineer, implementing GPO and modifying AD to improve ASR rules through pilot groups. I had to self-teach myself PowerShell and Batch.
