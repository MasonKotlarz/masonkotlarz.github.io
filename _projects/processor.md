Designed and created, in VHDL, a **Single Cycle Processor**, **Software Scheduled Pipeline Processor**, and a **Hardware Scheduled Pipeline Processor** (with a branch predictor, data forwarding, and minimal instruction flushing).

### Intro
This project was the most time consuming and effort intensive projects I undertook during my time at Iowa State University. The deliverable for this project was a 5 stage pipelined proceessor with hardware enforced data forwarding capabilities. This required our team to use everything we had learned about CPU design and more in order to finish on time.

### Lessons Learned
CprE 381 will be the class I remember the most from my undergraduate degree program. It was the class that brough all of the different computing concepts I had leared up to this point together and made me realize what it takes to run a computer. Before taking 381 I understood that computers operated on 1’s and 0’s. I also knew how to program in languages like C. I was missing out on the knowledge of how computers translate that code into 1’s and 0’s and how those bits get carried around the physical hardware of a CPU to make anything happen. 381 forced me to not only experience these aspects of computer but to truly learn them.
