# Senior Design - LM Fuzzing

Problem Statement: 

Security testing can be a lengthy and difficult process. Many problems can exist within a software system, and it takes extensive time and effort for testers to identify them. To assist with this process, many engineers use automated fuzzers. Modern-day fuzzing involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as input to a program to uncover software vulnerabilities and bugs. Oftentimes, fuzzers are used by engineers in professional settings to perform a security evaluation on specific programs being developed for quality assurance and as part of the secure development life cycle. Fuzzers may also be used by individuals performing independent research while trying to expose new vulnerabilities across many different applications. Modern fuzzers are highly effective, but they are slow and limited in scope. Due to the nondeterministic nature of fuzzing, our team believes this issue is a fantastic application for Artificial Intelligence (AI).
