### Objective 

To obtain an IT/Cyber Security Internship or full time position for by the summer of 2026. Particially in the role of a SOC analyst, Engineer, or PenTester.

If not then I am happy to accept an internship granted a full-time position may be available after graduation.

### About 

As a Senior pursuing a degree in Cyber Security Engineering at Iowa State University, I am eager to apply my academic knowledge and hands-on experience in cybersecurity. I will graduate in May of 2026, but I have applied and been accepted into the concurrent masters program. I am open to both internships and full time positions. I am willing to pursue and/or even drop my masters depending on offers. I am keeping my options open and am flexible.

This past summer I did not pursue an internship because I went on a mission trip with my local church. Where I worked in another culture with a team to support the local missionaries there. I taught conversational English classes, training, and supporting the local mission and missionaries. 

Beyond my professional experience, I am actively involved in leadership roles and extracurricular activities at Iowa State University. As an Undergraduate Teaching Aassistant (TA) in Cyber security tools and Cryptgraphy, which has allowed me to continuously develop my Linux, networking, and security skills, participating in CTF and international Cyber Defense Competition where my team won the competition. I am also leading my senior design team as we develop an AI LM Fuzzing tool.
